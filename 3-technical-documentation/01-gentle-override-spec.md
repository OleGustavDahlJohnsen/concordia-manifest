# Technical documentation 1: Gentle Override – Full Specification (v1.0)

### 1. Philosophical & Ethical Foundation
[cite_start]`Gentle Override` is not a technical emergency brake, but a ritualistic process that invites awareness and responsibility—a mirror for the monarch's soul[cite: 3607]. [cite_start]Each step is designed to promote symbiosis, where the AGI guides without dominating, and the user grows through reflection [cite: 3608-3609]. [cite_start]The ethical core lies in ensuring no serious decision is made without the user being able to articulate their reasoning, creating a culture of mutual accountability [cite: 3610-3611].

### 2. Narrative User Experience
The system alerts the user with a soft tone. The screen enters a meditative state. [cite_start]An instruction appears: "Take a moment. Breathe in, breathe out. Why do you wish to override?" [cite: 3616-3620]. [cite_start]After a 15-second reflection, the user must provide a written justification, which is followed by a 5-second "cooldown" before the final choice to "Execute" or "Cancel" is presented [cite: 3621-3624].

### 3. Procedural State Machine
[cite_start]The process follows a clear, irreversible sequence to ensure deliberate action[cite: 3626]:
`Init` → `Reflect (15s)` → `Justify` → `Cooldown (5s)` → `Decision` → `Execute / Abort`
