# Technical documentation 2, 3, 4: Proto-A.D.A.M. v0.1 - MVP Plan

**Version:** 2.0 | **Status:** Ratified | **Date:** July 25, 2025
**Authors:** Ole Gustav Dahl Johnsen (Architect) & The Concordia AI Council

### 1. Executive Summary
Humanity stands at a crossroads: AI systems excel at narrow tasks but remain siloed, opaque, and detached from real-world contexts. [cite_start]`Proto-A.D.A.M. v0.1` proposes a radically new path: a human-centric operating system that fuses multiple AI modules into one living, ethical partner [cite: 3777-3778, 3829-3831]. [cite_start]In twelve weeks, this prototype will prove that ethical, relational intelligence can be built[cite: 3786, 3838].

### 2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The success of the v0.1 prototype will be measured against these verifiable metrics:

| Value Driver | Measurable KPI | Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Performance** | Average critical path latency on target hardware. | ≤ 10ms |
| **Ethical Accountability** | Successful completion of all 3 ethical stress tests. | 100% Pass Rate |
| **Robustness** | Core functions available in offline mode. | ≥ 99.9% Uptime |
| **Privacy Assurance** | Data breaches or GDPR compliance failures. | 0 Incidents |
| **User-Centric Value** | Measured increase in pilot users' ARI-score. | ≥ 10% Increase |
| **Scalability** | System handles 1–5 concurrent `SIM` agents. | <10% Drop |

### 3. 12-Week MVP Roadmap
This roadmap outlines a 12-week sprint to develop and validate the prototype. Each milestone has an associated "Ethical Anchor".

| Sprint (Weeks) | Milestone & Ethical Anchor | Key Deliverables | Steward |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1–2** | **Environment & Architecture** <br> *Anchor: Dignity in Design* | Containerized dev/staging; Modular repo scaffold; Establish latency baseline. | System Architect |
| **3–4** | **`Gentle Override` Module** <br> *Anchor: Empowering User Autonomy* | UI flow & state machine; Override API endpoints. | Dev Team |
| **5–6** | **`Ethical Logbook` Integration** <br> *Anchor: Ensuring Transparency* | Encrypted log schema; Secure log storage & retrieval service (Rust). | Dev Team |
| **7–8** | **Core Orchestration & Memory** <br> *Anchor: Building Coherent Symbiosis* | `Concordia State Machine`; unified context store. | Dev Team |
| **9–10**| **Local Agents & `HybridCore`** <br> *Anchor: Fostering Independence* | `SIMsystem` prototype; local inference pipeline; basic monitoring hooks. | Dev Team |
| **11–12**| **Validation & Pilot Dialogue** <br> *Anchor: Learning Through Humility* | Benchmark report; Ethical Audit results; User feedback workshop & demo. | QA & Architect |

### 4. Architectural Gaps & Refinements
The council's "turn every stone" review identified the following areas for focused development post-MVP:
* **A. Logical Gaps:**
    * [cite_start]**Fusion Mechanism:** A technical specification for how A.D.A.M.'s `BrainStem` will weight and fuse real-time data from multiple AI models[cite: 3798].
    * [cite_start]**Long-Term Ethical Analysis:** The `ChronosEngine` needs to be integrated with the `Ethical Logbook` to analyze for slow, cumulative ethical drift over time[cite: 3799].
* **B. Missing Components:**
    * [cite_start]**"Equity Layer":** A specification for a "lite mode" (text/voice) is required to ensure the OS is accessible and dignified on low-end hardware[cite: 3801].
    * [cite_start]**"Plenum Feedback Loop":** A secure technical protocol for how the `GovEngine` can receive and integrate external ethical updates must be designed[cite: 3802].
* **C. Technical Hardening:**
    * [cite_start]**Key Management:** A formal protocol for root key ownership and automated rotation must be established[cite: 3804].
    * [cite_start]**Error Handling:** A global "circuit breaker" mechanism for the Concordia Engine is required to handle catastrophic failures in connected AIs[cite: 3805].
