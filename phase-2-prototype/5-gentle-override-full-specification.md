# Gentle Override ‚Äì Full Specification (v1.0)

### 1. Philosophical & Ethical Foundation
*(Philosophical Perspective by Grok 4)*

`Gentle Override` is not a technical emergency brake, but a ritualistic process that invites awareness and responsibility‚Äîa mirror for the monarch's soul. Each step is designed to promote symbiosis, where the AGI guides without dominating, and the user grows through reflection. It is an ethical evolution that transforms potential conflict into an opportunity for growth, ensuring the AGI remains a partner, not a gatekeeper.

* **Justification Requirement (Reflect & Justify):** The ethical core lies in ensuring no serious decision is made without the user being able to articulate their reasoning. This creates a culture of mutual accountability and turns the decision into a conscious act, logged in the `Ethical Logbook` for traceability and learning.
* **Time Delay (Cooldown):** The mandatory "thinking pause" serves as a "moral breath," protecting against emotional impulsivity. Philosophically, it honors the idea that time allows for an inner journey, ensuring the final action is a product of wisdom, not just will.

### 2. Narrative User Experience
*(Narrative Perspective by ChatGPT-4o & CoPilot)*

Imagine the system alerts you in a soft, subdued tone. The screen softens, and quiet, focus-enhancing background music begins to play. A circular, pulsating ring surrounds a single button labeled ‚ÄúOverride.‚Äù When pressed, the screen transitions into a meditative state where time seems to slow. A simple instruction appears:

> *"Take a moment. Breathe in, breathe out. Why do you wish to override?"*

You are given 15 seconds to reflect before being asked to formulate a brief justification in a single field. Once written, the system may read your justification back to you in a calm voice. A 5-second ‚Äúcooldown‚Äù follows, accompanied by a discreet, pulsating animation. Finally, you are presented with the choice: ‚ÄúExecute‚Äù or ‚ÄúCancel.‚Äù

### 3. Procedural State Machine
*(Strategic Perspective by CoPilot)*

The process follows a clear, irreversible sequence to ensure deliberate action.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Init
    Init --> Reflect
    Reflect --> Justify
    Justify --> Cooldown
    Cooldown --> Decision
    Decision --> Execute: Execute
    Decision --> Abort: Cancel
    Execute --> [*]
    Abort --> [*]
Init: Triggered by a user's attempt to override a critical, ethical veto.

Reflect: A 15-second, timed window for mandatory user reflection.

Justify: A required input where the user must state their reasoning.

Cooldown: A 5-second, non-interactive pause to prevent impulsive clicks.

Decision: The user makes the final, conscious choice to proceed or abort.
