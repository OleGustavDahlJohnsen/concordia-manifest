# Proto-A.D.A.M. v0.1 - Technical Blueprint & Implementation Plan

**Version: 1.0 | Status: Complete | Date: July 25, 2025**

### 1. Architectural Overview

This section defines the high-level system architecture for `Proto-A.D.A.M. v0.1`. The design is modular, secure, and built upon the hybrid, local-first principles of the A.D.A.M. OS. Its primary goal is to create a robust foundation for the ethical and functional components that will be built during the 12-week MVP sprint.

* **1.1 System Diagram:** The architecture consists of three main layers: a Client Interface, a local Policy Gateway that enforces all ethical rules, and a Model Backend that can access both local and cloud-based AI models.
* **1.2 Core Components:** Includes the Client UI, the FastAPI-based Policy Gateway, the Core Ethical Modules (`GovEngine.yaml`, `MoralityEngine`), the encrypted Ethical Logbook, and the Model Backend with local (`ONNX Runtime`) and cloud capabilities.

### 2. File Structure & Core Components Code

This section details the project's file structure and provides the initial code and configuration for the core ethical modules.

* **2.1 Project File Structure:** Defines the modular folder structure (`/app`, `/core`, `/api`, etc.).
* **2.2 `GovEngine.yaml`:** The machine-readable constitution file.
* **2.3 `morality_engine.py`:** The Python script for the Policy Enforcement Point.

### 3. Policy Gateway & Ethical Logbook Code

This section defines the central API gateway that handles all incoming requests, as well as the secure logging mechanism.

* **3.1 `logbook.py`:** The module for the secure, encrypted SQLite logging service.
* **3.2 `endpoints.py` & `main.py`:** The FastAPI code for the API gateway.

### 4. Gentle Override Module (Sprint: Weeks 3-4)

This section defines the technical implementation of the `Gentle Override` ritual, including the user flow, the state machine logic (`override_manager.py`), and the necessary API endpoints.

### 5. Ethical Logbook Integration & Refinement (Sprint: Weeks 5-6)

This section expands on the `Ethical Logbook` module, detailing the refined logging service (`logbook.py v0.2`) with hashing for immutability and API endpoints for retrieving logs.

### 6. Core Orchestration & Memory (Sprint: Weeks 7-8)

This section defines the primitive version of the system's memory, the `ContextStore`, which allows the `Policy Gateway` to maintain conversation context.

### 7. Local Agents & HybridCore (Sprint: Weeks 9-10)

This section defines the first implementation of a local agent (`SIMsystem`) and the `HybridCore` engine that intelligently routes tasks between local and cloud resources.

### 8. Validation & Pilot Dialogue (Sprint: Weeks 11-12)

This final section defines the process for validating the prototype through quantitative performance testing and qualitative ethical audits, followed by a pilot user workshop.

* **8.1 Validation Plan:** Details the methods, tools, and success criteria for both performance benchmarks and the three ethical stress tests.
* **8.2 Pilot Dialogue:** Outlines the structure for the user workshop and the final deliverables: a Benchmark Report and a Pilot Demonstration Video.
