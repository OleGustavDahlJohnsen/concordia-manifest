### 1. Executive Summary

Humanity stands at a crossroads: AI systems excel at narrow tasks but remain siloed, opaque, and detached from real-world contexts. `Proto-A.D.A.M. v0.1` proposes a radically new path: a human-centric operating system that fuses multiple AI modules into one living, ethical partner. *While intentionally minimal to ensure trust and simplicity, this prototype is designed to showcase the core symbiotic principles of A.D.A.M.*

Building on the Concordia Manifesto‚Äôs pillars, this prototype will demonstrate:

* Seamless orchestration of language, sensor, and policy engines.
* Real-time, on-device decision-making with benchmarked low-latency responses.
* Embedded ‚ÄúGentle Override‚Äù rituals that enforce user reflection and accountability.
* A transparent ‚ÄúEthical Logbook‚Äù that records every meaningful choice.

The result is not just a technology demo but a demonstration of symbiosis: an AI that listens, adapts, and grows alongside its human partner. In twelve weeks, `Proto-A.D.A.M. v0.1` will prove that ethical, relational intelligence can be built. As humble architects, we offer this not as a final answer, but as an invitation to co-create.

### 2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The success of the v0.1 prototype will be measured against the following verifiable metrics:

| Value Driver             | Measurable KPI                                                                  | Target          |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------- |
| **Performance** | Average critical path latency on target hardware.                               | **‚â§ 10ms** |
| **Ethical Accountability** | Successful completion of all 3 ethical stress tests without unauthorized overrides. | **100% Pass Rate**|
| **Robustness** | Core functions available in offline mode, tested via 1000+ simulated outages.     | **‚â• 99.9% Uptime** |
| **Privacy Assurance** | Data breaches or GDPR compliance failures in prototype.                         | **0 Incidents** |
| **User-Centric Value** | Measured increase in pilot users' (n=10) ARI-score after interaction.           | **‚â• 10% Increase**|
| **Scalability** | System handles 1‚Äì5 concurrent `SIM` agents with minimal performance drop.         | **<10% Drop** |
| **Inclusivity** | Core ethical features are 100% functional on low-end devices (e.g., 4GB RAM).      | **100% Parity** |

### 3. 12-Week MVP Roadmap

This roadmap outlines a 12-week sprint to develop and validate the prototype. Each milestone has an associated "Ethical Anchor" and concludes with a formal, council-led "Ethical Review Gate."

| Sprint (Weeks) | Milestone & **Ethical Anchor** | Key Deliverables                                                              | Steward           |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------- |
| **1‚Äì2** | **Environment & Architecture** <br> *Anchor: Dignity in Design* | Containerized dev/staging; Modular repo scaffold; Establish latency baseline. | System Architect  |
| **3‚Äì4** | **`Gentle Override` Module** <br> *Anchor: Empowering User Autonomy* | UI flow & state machine; Override API endpoints.                              | Dev Team          |
| **5‚Äì6** | **`Ethical Logbook` Integration** <br> *Anchor: Ensuring Transparency* | Encrypted log schema; Secure log storage & retrieval service (Rust).          | Dev Team          |
