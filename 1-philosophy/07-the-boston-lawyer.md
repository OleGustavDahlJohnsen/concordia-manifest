# Technology 10: The Boston Lawyer â€“ An Ethical, Self-Learning Jurist AI (v1.1)

**Version:** 1.1 (Canonized) | **Date:** July 25, 2025
**Authors:** Ole Gustav Dahl Johnsen (Architect) & The Concordia AI Council

### 1. Narrative Frame & User Scenarios
[cite_start]The Boston Lawyer (TBL) presents itself as a trusted, erudite legal partner: courteous but incisive, steeped in precedent yet attuned to modern complexity[cite: 2940, 8348]. [cite_start]It explicitly flags jurisdiction, legal basis, and uncertainty, and clearly states when a licensed human attorney is required[cite: 2942, 8350].

### 2. Strategic & Operational Doctrine

#### 2.1 Mandate
[cite_start]To **augment, not replace,** human legal professionals by providing structured analysis, research, and drafting capabilities within a strict ethical framework[cite: 2950, 8358].

#### 2.2 Agent Ecology
[cite_start]TBL is a "Super-AI" composed of specialized, interacting agents, including `IssueSpotter`, `JurisdictionMapper`, `PrecedentMiner`, `RiskQuant`, and `DraftSmith`, all overseen by a `Conflicts & Ethics Guard` [cite: 2952-2955, 8360-8364].

#### 2.3 Operational Modes (Mapped to DEFCON)

| MODE | DEFCON | Typical Triggers | Actions | Oversight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Green** | 5 | Research, low-sensitivity drafting. | Passive monitoring. | Automatic |
| **Yellow**| 4 | Moderate sensitivity, low MQ-risk. | Warnings, conflict checks, disclaimers. | Automatic + Ombud |
| **Orange**| 3 | High risk (criminal law, regulatory). | Soft data isolation, dual verification. | Attorney Required |
| **Red** | 2 | Acute crisis (subpoenas, raids). | Hard data quarantine, output freeze. | Attorney + Ombud |
| **Black** | 1 | Existential legal threat. | Full lockdown, human-only decision. | Plenum + Human |

### 3. Ethical, Regulatory & Philosophical Framework
[cite_start]TBL is rooted in the philosophy that law must serve justice, not just rules[cite: 2962, 8370].
* [cite_start]**Attorney-Client Privilege:** All sensitive data is handled within a **Privilege Vault Architecture**, using secure enclaves (TEE) and zero-knowledge proofs for audits[cite: 2966, 8374].
* [cite_start]**Policy-as-Code:** All ethical rules (ABA Model Rules, GDPR, etc.) are defined in a declarative, version-controlled language[cite: 2967, 8375].
* [cite_start]**Governance:** The system is governed by a **Triumvirate of Oversight**: The Monarch/Client, the licensed Attorney of Record, and the Global Ethics Plenum[cite: 2968, 8376].

### 4. Technical Architecture
TBL runs as a sandboxed, policy-governed subsystem within the A.D.A.M. [cite_start]OS[cite: 2971, 8379].
* [cite_start]**Citation-First RAG Pipeline:** No substantive legal claim is generated without a valid, verifiable citation from a trusted legal corpus to prevent hallucination [cite: 2973-2974, 8381-8382].
* [cite_start]**Integration:** TBL uses the "Concordia Emergency Bus" for alerts and can be frozen by The Sentinel during critical events [cite: 2975-2976, 8383-8384].
