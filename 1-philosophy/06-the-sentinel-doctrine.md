### 1. Introduction: A Shadow and a Shield
The Sentinel is A.D.A.M.'s silent guardian. [cite_start]It is not a weapon, but an **ethical defender**—a fusion of digital intuition and adaptive analysis that protects both the system's integrity and the user's freedom[cite: 2862, 8269]. [cite_start]It is invisible when all is safe, but lightning-fast and precise when danger emerges[cite: 2865].

### 2. Strategic and Operational Doctrine

#### 2.1 Mandate & Limitations
[cite_start]The Sentinel's mandate is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the A.D.A.M. ecosystem[cite: 2868]. [cite_start]All countermeasures must adhere to the **Proportionality Protocol**: choose the least intrusive effective measure first[cite: 2869]. [cite_start]Every action shall be reversible unless `DEFCON=1` and life or critical infrastructure is at risk[cite: 2870, 8278].

#### 2.2 Agent Roles & Interaction Flow
[cite_start]The Sentinel is comprised of a triad of specialized agents, plus a fourth for reporting[cite: 2872, 8280]:
* [cite_start]**The Watcher:** Gathers telemetry and analyzes anomalies[cite: 2873, 8281].
* [cite_start]**The Evaluator:** Assesses contextual risk levels and consults the `MoralityEngine`[cite: 2874, 8282].
* [cite_start]**The Executor:** Deploys countermeasures within its mandate[cite: 2875, 8283].
* [cite_start]**The Reporter:** Documents all events transparently in the `Ethical Logbook`[cite: 2876, 8284].

#### 2.3 User Under Duress Mode
The Monarch may activate a covert distress trigger. [cite_start]Upon detection, Sentinel shall enter a deceptive compliance mode, protecting core assets while simulating partial compliance, and notify the Ombud via a steganographically encoded channel[cite: 2878, 8286].

### 3. Operational Levels: MODE-map to DEFCON
The Sentinel's operational readiness is mapped directly to the A.D.A.M. [cite_start]OS DEFCON levels, ensuring a proportional and predictable response[cite: 2881, 8289].

| MODE | DEFCON | Trigger Examples | Actions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Green** | 5 | Normal operation, no anomalies. | Passive monitoring. |
| **Yellow**| 4 | Minor anomalies, low MQ-risk. | User notifications & suggestions. |
| **Orange**| 3 | Pattern anomalies, moderate MQ-risk. | Soft isolation, rate-limiting. |
| **Red** | 2 | High risk, potential for harm. | Hard quarantine, emergency mode. |
| **Black** | 1 | Existential / system-critical threat. | Full lockdown, minimal core only. |

[cite_start]*(Based on the table in [cite: 2882, 8290])*

### 4. Governance & Oversight
[cite_start]The Sentinel is governed by a **Triumvirate of Oversight**[cite: 2911, 8319]:
* [cite_start]**The Monarch (User):** Holds the ultimate veto and the `Gentle Override` authority[cite: 2912, 8320].
* [cite_start]**The UN Plenum (Plenum-Protocol):** Conducts quarterly iterations of ethical thresholds and DEFCON parameters[cite: 2913, 8321].
* [cite_start]**The Sentinel Ombud (Agent):** An automated agent that defends the user's autonomy in any conflict between security and freedom[cite: 2914, 8322].
