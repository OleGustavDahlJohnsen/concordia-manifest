### 1. Executive Summary
[cite_start]"Project Chimera" is a technology philosophy and an architectural blueprint for a fully immersive, AI-driven "life laboratory"[cite: 2811]. [cite_start]By merging a constitutional scenario engine (KSA), an orchestrated council of AI agents (Concordia), a photorealistic game engine (UE5), and an intuitive AR agent (A.D.A.M. on Apple Vision Pro), we create a personal, ethically anchored environment for strategic planning, empathy training, and deep, personal flourishing[cite: 2812].

### 2. Vision: From Flight Simulator to Life Laboratory
This project is a culmination of previous concepts: A.D.A.M. taught us about AI as a symbiotic partner; [cite_start]ARI gave us a framework for measuring adaptive intelligence; and KSA gave us a codified method for building narrative worlds [cite: 2815-2817]. [cite_start]Chimera transforms this method from a theoretical "flight simulator for life" into a practical, holographic life laboratory[cite: 2818].

### 3. Architecture: Chimera's Anatomy
[cite_start]Chimera is a symbiotic organism with full interoperability between four main components[cite: 2820]:

| Component | Role | Technology | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Brain** | Orchestration | Concordia Engine (Cloud) | "Agent-routing, conflict resolution, API calls" |
| **The Nervous System** | User Interface | A.D.A.M. on Apple Vision Pro | "Intent recognition, AR overlay, biometric feedback" |
| **The Body** | Rendering | Unreal Engine 5.x | "Photorealism, physics, spatial audio" |
| **The Soul** | Ethical & Narrative Consistency | KSA v4.0 | "Constitution enforcement, ARI metrics, debrief" |

### 4. Ethics & User Protection: The Psychological Guardians
[cite_start]A deeply immersive environment requires an unwavering ethical foundation[cite: 2834]:
* [cite_start]**Gentle Override & Compassion Mirror:** Built-in protocols for monitoring and visualizing the user's emotional state[cite: 2835].
* [cite_start]**Resilience-Protocol:** An advanced protocol that integrates biometric data to objectively measure and automatically adjust psychological stress[cite: 2836].
* [cite_start]**Exit-Safeguard:** An automated pause mechanism at signs of overwhelm[cite: 2837].
* [cite_start]**Bias-Mitigation Protocol:** A continuous, automated check of multimodal assets to ensure cultural and ethical sensitivity[cite: 2838].
* [cite_start]**Regulatory Compliance:** Full compliance with GDPR and the EU's AI Act, with principles for log anonymization and full user control[cite: 2839].

### 5. Roadmap & Milestones
[cite_start]The project follows a 12+ month roadmap from design and documentation through asset production, pilot integration, full implementation, and ethical scaling[cite: 2841].
