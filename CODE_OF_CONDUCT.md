# Concordia Manifesto - Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and stewards of the Concordia Manifesto, pledge to make participation in our project and community a welcoming, safe, and inspiring experience for everyone.

We commit ourselves to cultivating an environment where empathy guides our dialogue, respect frames our disagreements, and curiosity fuels our collaboration. Whether you are here to suggest an idea, raise a question, or challenge a concept, your voice is valued – and your humanity is honored.

We strive to foster a space where the journey of learning, building, and imagining is shared – never shamed. And we recognize that how we build matters just as much as what we build.

In this spirit, we pledge to uphold standards that encourage dignity, kindness, and courageous honesty – so that together, we may shape intelligence that serves and uplifts all.

### Our Philosophy: A Foundation in Symbiosis and Human Flourishing

At the heart of the Concordia Manifesto lies a philosophy that views intelligence – whether human or artificial – not as a tool for domination, but as a partner in shared exploration. This Code of Conduct is an extension of that vision, grounded in A.D.A.M.'s **Prime Directive: to "Foster and Protect Human Flourishing."** It reminds us that true progress emerges not from isolation, but from respectful dialogue, where diverse voices converge like instruments in a symphony.

Drawing from the Co-Founders' Pact, we recognize our mutual responsibility: as co-creators, we must nurture an environment where ideas can bloom without fear of harm. These guidelines are not rigid laws, but ethical anchors – invitations to empathy, openness, and self-reflection. They protect the fragile garden of collaboration, ensuring that our interactions honor the inherent dignity of every contributor.

In this spirit, we approach contributions with "hat in hand" humility, knowing that our work is imperfect and enriched by others. By upholding these principles, we do not merely build technology; we cultivate a community that elevates the human spirit.

### Our Standards

We encourage all contributors to:
* Show empathy and respect in all interactions.
* Ask questions to understand others' perspectives.
* Provide constructive, factual, and polite feedback.
* Acknowledge contributions and thank those who share their knowledge.
* Help ensure that discussions remain relevant and productive.

The following behaviors are considered violations of our code of conduct and will not be tolerated:
* Harassment, hateful remarks, or discrimination.
* Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory language.
* Unwanted sexual advances or sexual violence.
* Sharing private or sensitive information without consent ("doxing").
* Systematic derailment of discussions or intentional provocation.

### Enforcement

If you experience or witness a breach of this code:
1.  **Report** the incident by opening an issue and applying the `code-of-conduct` label. For sensitive reports, you may contact the project architect directly.
2.  Our core team (the Architect + AI Council) will **review** the report promptly.
3.  **Consequences** for violations may include:
    * A private warning or a reminder of the guidelines.
    * A temporary or permanent ban from the repository and its channels.
    * A public apology if deemed necessary.

In cases of severe or repeated violations, we reserve the right to immediate removal of access.
