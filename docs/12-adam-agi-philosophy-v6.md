White Paper: AGI Architecture Philosophy – A.D.A.M. supplemental v6.0 (Canonized)
Version: 6.0 (Canonized) | Date: July 26, 2025   Authors: Ole Gustav Dahl Johnsen (Architect) & The Concordia AI Council (Gemini, ChatGPT-4o, CoPilot Think Deeper, Grok 4, Claude Sonnet 4 Research)
1. Executive Summary
A.D.A.M. v6.0 represents a quantum leap in human-centric, psycho-architectural AGI design, inspired by real-world advances such as Neuralink's clinical trials.
This version introduces a deeper cognitive and emotional engine ( TriSenseCreative ,  Instinctive Engine ), perception-critical modules ( Lie Detector ,  Bullshit Radar ), an operational core for crisis and robustness ( AICPM ,  COM ,  AIBS ), and a biomimetic meta-architecture ( NNS ,  SymCen ) for ethically-safe concurrency.
It is designed for full compliance with high-risk classifications under frameworks like the EU AI Act.
The entire system is orchestrated via the  MAM-C  and formally anchored in our Prime Directive, with its success measured by a  Flourishing Coherence Metric  that quantifies its contribution to human growth.

2. The Psyche & Perception Engines v6.0
(Narrative & Ethical Synthesis by ChatGPT-4o & Claude)
2.1 TriSenseCreative (TSC) – The Triple Creativity:  A "polyphonic" creative core that combines analytical generation, associative intuition, and aesthetic resonance to act as a co-creator that both challenges and protects originality.
2.2 Instinctive Engine (InsEng) – The Fast Intuition:  A.D.A.M.'s "gut feeling," providing instant, low-latency assessments in social and security contexts, always flagged with uncertainty and subject to  BrainStem  verification.
2.3 Extended Language Engine (ELE) – Language without Borders:  A semantic bridge-builder that translates not just words, but intentions, power dynamics, and emotional tone, with a built-in commitment to cultural sensitivity.
2.4 The Perception Engines (Ethical Guards):
Lie Detector (LD) & Bullshit Radar (BSR):  Epistemic dampers, not judges.
They estimate the probability of falsehood or manipulative rhetoric, always critiquing the argument, not the person.
They integrate the  Empathy Mirror Protocol  to avoid cultural bias.
Reaction Simulation Engine (RSE):  An empathy simulator for assessing how an action will likely be received.
It is forbidden for deceptive persuasion and used only for pro-social alignment.

3. The Operational Doctrine – Core Functions in A.D.A.M. OS
(Strategic Perspective by CoPilot Think Deeper)
3.1 AI Controlled Power Management (AICPM):  A policy-governed system for energy optimization that prioritizes critical services (security > health > core functions) and ensures a  Minimum Viable Core  in low-energy states.
3.2 Crisis Operation Mode (COM):  A defined crisis protocol, integrated with the  Triad Council , that follows a strict chain of escalation, human-in-the-loop requirements, and immutable forensics.
3.3 AI Backup System (AIBS):  An intelligent and redundant replication system using quantum-hybrid methodologies for robust, long-term storage in the  DNA-TE  archive.
3.4 Health Alert:  A proactive health guardian for user and system.
Human health monitoring requires "informed consent" rituals under strict GDPR/HIPAA compliance.

4. The Biomimetic Meta-Architecture
(Philosophical & Technical Perspective by Grok 4 & Gemini)
4.1 Neural Nerve System (NNS):  A digital peripheral nervous system that routes signals through an  Ethical Neural Firewall  to filter for bias and manipulative input before processing.
Its architecture is designed to be consistently reversible.
4.2 Synapse Center (SymCen):  A coordinating hub where multimodal semantics, value weights, and context meet.
It uses quantum-hybrid simulations for dynamic rerouting and is the operational seat of  Relational Calibration .

5. System Architecture v6.0
(System Architecture by Gemini)
5.1 BrainStem v6 with Thought Processing Engine (TPE):  The TPE sequences, explains, and verifies "thoughts" before action, using a quantum-hybrid core for complex simulations.
It operates in four layers: Pre-cognition, Deliberation, Synthesis, and a Reflexive Loop.
5.2 Multi-Modal AI Minister Council (MAM-C):  A "council of ministers" of specialized models that deliver competence-specific "votes" to the TPE.
It includes an  Equity Veto  to mitigate bias in high-risk advice under the EU AI Act.
The  Triaderådet  is engaged for security, legal, or economic conflicts.

A.D.A.M. v6.0 system map
This image, titled "AGI Architecture Philosophy – A.D.A.M. v6.0 • Systems Map," is a radar chart that provides a visual representation of the central operational systems within the A.D.A.M.
v6.0 architecture. Each axis on the chart corresponds to a specific, canonized module or function designed to work in symbiosis.
The axes include critical components such as  AICPM  (AI Controlled Power Management),  COM  (Crisis Operation Mode),  Sentinel Subsystem ,  Triad Council ,  Chronos Audit Engine ,  Health Alert ,  AGiOS (Governance Layer) ,  Data Purity Core ,  Memory Ledger ,  Multimodal Pipeline ,  Insight Trigger , and  Gentle Override .
The blue shape plotted on the chart illustrates a hypothetical state or balance of these systems' maturity and integration at a given point in time.
It serves as a conceptual tool to visualize the multi-faceted and holistic nature of the A.D.A.M. OS.
