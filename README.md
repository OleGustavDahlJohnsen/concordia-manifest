### **About This Project**

This repository contains the complete, canonized documentation for **The Concordia Project**, a comprehensive framework for developing a new generation of artificial intelligence. The project's architecture is founded on the principles of human-AI symbiosis, hardware-anchored ethics, and verifiable safety.

**Project Status:** `ARCHITECTURAL PHASE COMPLETE (Version 8.2)`
* **Latest Milestone:** The **Concordia Layer 0 (v4.0)** white paper is finalized and approved, marking a major new keystone in the ecosystem.

### ‚ú® Newest Keystone: Concordia Layer 0

![Concordia Layer 0 Logo](concordia-layer-0.png)

The most recently completed pillar of the Concordia ecosystem is **Layer 0**, a foundational white paper detailing an ethical and empathetic sensory layer designed to shift the paradigm **from autonomy to symbiosis**. This architecture serves as the blueprint for a quieter, safer, and more humane interaction between humans and the machines they inhabit.
