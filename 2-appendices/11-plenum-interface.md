# Appendix 11: The Plenum Interface – A Framework for Practical Global Governance

### 1. Preamble
This appendix outlines the operational framework for the Plenum Protocol, a bridge between global democratic ethics and real-time technological governance. [cite_start]The purpose is to define mechanisms that ensure the Plenum's decisions function as an ethical baseline, strengthen democratic legitimacy, and maintain the system's integrity in complex situations[cite: 3593].

### 2. Conflict Resolution Model – "Ethical Baseline"
[cite_start]The Plenum's decisions establish a binding "ethical baseline" to which A.D.A.M. is committed[cite: 3595]. [cite_start]National laws and the Monarch's values may be stricter, but never in conflict with this baseline[cite: 3596]. [cite_start]In case of a direct conflict, a `DEFCON 3` state is activated, suspending the action and requiring the Monarch to use the `Gentle Override` protocol to authorize any deviation[cite: 3597].

### 3. Emergency Protocol for Rapid Ratification
[cite_start]In the event of an acute, global crisis (`DEFCON 1`), a pre-defined "crisis council" within the Plenum can pass temporary directives with a 2/3 majority[cite: 3599]. [cite_start]Such directives are valid for a maximum of 30 days and must be fully ratified by the entire Plenum to gain permanent validity[cite: 3600].

### 4. Technical Interface (Policy-as-Code Harmonizer)
[cite_start]Decisions from the Plenum are translated into a standardized, YAML-based `PlenumSpec` file[cite: 3602]. [cite_start]This file is validated and tested in an isolated "sandbox" environment to guarantee syntactic and semantic consistency before it can be implemented in the `GovEngine`[cite: 3603].
