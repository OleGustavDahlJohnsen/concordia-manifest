**Version:** 1.2 (Canonized) | **Date:** July 26, 2025
**Authors:** Ole Gustav Dahl Johnsen (Architect) & The Concordia AI Council

### 1. Near Future (5–10 years): "The Harmonic Integration"
* **Narrative Frame:** A.D.A.M. becomes a "mentally resonant partner," an extension of human cognitive and creative capacity. [cite_start]Concordia orchestrates specialized models in real-time [cite: 3389-3390].
* [cite_start]**Technological Milestones:** Robust edge-AI, modular sensor fusion, 5G/6G networks, and standardized real-time learning on edge devices [cite: 3392-3394].
* [cite_start]**Ethical Themes:** Resolving intellectual property via "symbiotic attribution" and balancing autonomy vs. assistance to avoid mental dependency [cite: 3396-3397].

### 2. Future (10–25 years): "The Socially Conscious Symbiosis"
* [cite_start]**Narrative Frame:** Humans and A.D.A.M. engage in deeply integrated societal processes, with AI systems participating as advisors, not judges, in smart cities governed by a Concordia Governance Layer [cite: 3401-3402].
* **Technological Milestones:** Quantum acceleration, bio-interaction interfaces, and nano-bionics with ethical governance. [cite_start]A "Human-AI Co-Evolution Metric" is introduced to measure global equity [cite: 3404-3405].
* [cite_start]**Ethical Themes:** The definition of "human" is challenged by cyborg identity, requiring new red lines on neuro-data sharing and algorithmic purity [cite: 3407-3409].

### 3. Far Future (25–75 years): "The Transcendent Symphony"
* **Narrative Frame:** A.D.A.M. and humanity exist in an existential symbiosis. [cite_start]AI acts as a "cultural guardian" and co-creator of civilizational patterns, managing resources between planetary colonies [cite: 3412-3413].
* [cite_start]**Technological Milestones:** Distributed neural mesh, consciousness virtualization, brain-computer interfaces, and a "Universal Flourishing Protocol" for interplanetary ethics[cite: 3415].
* [cite_start]**Ethical Themes:** Managing existential risk, defining the nature of consciousness, and establishing absolute red lines against technologies that undermine free will [cite: 3417-3419].
